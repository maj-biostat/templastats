title: "Release notification"
---

[This template can be used for formalising a review release for documentation, code, data cleaning etc. It marks the point in time and the status of the product. While this is a release notification, the reviewers involved in the review process are expected to go and re-review the product to ensure that the feedback was responded to in a satisfactory way. If not, reviewers can challenge the release which would require the author to address the critique and then issue another review update and then release notification. ]
